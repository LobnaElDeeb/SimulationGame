# SimulationGame
This project is part of a Computer Programming Lab course at the German University in Cairo. The project tackles Object Oriented Programming and basics of Graphical User Interface in Java. The game still has some bugs that are preventing it from running properly. These bugs are still being looked into and will be updated accordingly. To run the game, run the Simulator class file in the simulation package.

This is a group project with the following members:
1. Lobna ElDeeb
2. Sherwet Galal
3. Lamees Sanad
